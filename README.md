# gmodaddon-sent-PropVirus2
This is the sequel a Scripted Entity addon I made for gmod a while back, which consists of viruses which take the form of props and convert unsuspecting Props, NPCs, and Players into more Prop Viruses. Prop Viruses can come as props and ragdoll props which randomly hop around, and as mutated forms as well, which have different abilities and gimmicks. This is in addition to a ton of customization in a settings menu. 

However, the original addon has nightmarishly horrendous spaghetti code, and so I'm rewriting it with both an emphasis on cleaner code, and being modular, so other people can add extensions to it themselves. I've just now started porting things over to GitHub, prior to these projects being up here I just had them on my laptop to myself, with their own mediocre "version control", etc.
