# gmodaddon-sent-PropVirus2
This is the sequel to a Scripted Entity addon I made for gmod a while back, my first addon in fact, which consists of viruses which take the form of props, converting props, NPCs, and players into more Prop Viruses upon making contact with them. Prop Viruses can come as props and ragdoll props which randomly hop around, and as mutated forms as well, which have different abilities and gimmicks. This is in addition to a ton of customization by means of a settings menu, with much more settings than the average addon, let alone scripted entity addon. 

However, the original addon has nightmarishly horrendous spaghetti code, beyond words, and so I'm rewriting it with both an emphasis on cleaner code, and being modular, so other people can add extensions to it themselves, not to mention while adding new things. I've just now started porting things over to GitHub, prior to these projects being up here I just had them on my laptop to myself, with their own mediocre "version control", etc. This is being done partly because the Steam Workshop has made it more difficult for others to look at newer .gma files, feel free to look at the code if you are curious about how something was done! Plus, I should be putting my scripts up here regardless I suppose. Oh well, better late than never.
